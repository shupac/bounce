Collision demo using jQuery

Fun little project I made back in the day when I first learned JavaScript. It was a good exercise in using the pseudoclassical instantiation pattern to create classes and superclasses. Vector calculations for surface-normal reflections. Glad the math I learned in engineering came in handy for something :)

Interesting things discovered along the way:
- Binding data and DOM
- Complex DOM selection
